# ANXIETY- Representing Emotion 
My objective for this first project was to represent one of the most 
common emotions that around 40 million Americans experience as well: ANXIETY.

P.S: Github absolutely hates me, LOL- so if the gif is not playing by itself, click on it :) 

## Sculpture

My paper sculpture was built using this [Template Maker](https://www.templatemaker.nl/en/boxlid/) site and illustrator. I used the Cricuit Maker to cut and draw the shapes out. I originally designed the heart for my graphic design class. It was inteded to be a part of a pattern- which would be used to create a cool merch brand; however, I saw the opportunity to use it for this project and took advantage of it.

I created my own blinking pattern and used the Mode Changer code to link my button to my LEDs. I purposely made the LEDs blink quickly and in different directions in order to convey the feeling of an anxious and racing heart. Many people identify with the feeling of an anxious heart- and I attempted to bring that feeling to life through this prototype.
