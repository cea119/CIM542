# ANXIETY- Representing Emotion 
My objective for this first project was to represent one of the most 
common emotions that around 40 million Americans experience as well: ANXIETY.

P.S: Github absolutely hates me, LOL- so if the gif is not playing by itself, click on it :) 

## Sculpture

My paper sculpture was built using this [Template Maker](https://www.templatemaker.nl/en/boxlid/) site and illustrator. I used the Cricuit Maker to cut the shapes out. I originally designed the heart for my graphic design class. It was inteded to be a part of a pattern- which would be used to create a cool merch brand; however, I saw the opportunity to use it for this project and took advantage of it.
