## PROJECT 3- Helpful Robot
### Final Project

Although I have been trying to read as little news as possible, due to all the negativity and tragedies going on, there is no escape from the tem "social distancing." The CDC also calls social distancing “physical distancing.” Meaning, keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your home.One of the most effective ways of complying with the social distancing protocol is staying around 6 feet apart from other people. Have you ever wondered why 6 feet? 

"Six feet is the average distance that respiratory droplets from a sneeze or cough travel before they settle and are no longer likely to be inhaled by other people. I have seen estimates for social distancing of up to 10 feet if someone sneezes quite hard, [or] does not cover their sneeze [or] cough,"

## Anti Social Social Bot

## Structure

To build my robot I used was Corona Extra 18-pack cardboard, Aleve medice box and some tape: all materials I had at home. To build the electronic part of the bot- I used the Arduino software for the code and Arduino hardware to make the code come to life. I created a robot that detects when people get too close to it- using an Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensor, buzzer and some wires to create a timer that recognizes movement due to proximity. The buzzer makes a loud noise once it senses movement. Although sad, until the vaccine/cure come around- social distancing is going to be our new normal, so we can use this boat as a reminder to practice physical distancing. 

Here are some pics as I was creating!

## ONSHAPE PROTOTYPE

Ideally the bot's structure would have been 3D printed; due to the stay at home restrictions, I had to buiild with what I had at home. 

## SKETCHES

This prototype was created using OnShape 3D sofware.
