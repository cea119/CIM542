## PROJECT 3- Helpful Robot
### Final Project

Although I have been trying to read as little news as possible, due to all the negativity and tragedies going on, there is no escape from the tem "social distancing." The CDC also calls social distancing “physical distancing.” Meaning, keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your home.One of the most effective ways of complying with the social distancing protocol is staying around 6 feet apart from other people. Have you ever wondered why 6 feet? 

"Six feet is the average distance that respiratory droplets from a sneeze or cough travel before they settle and are no longer likely to be inhaled by other people. I have seen estimates for social distancing of up to 10 feet if someone sneezes quite hard, [or] does not cover their sneeze [or] cough,"

## Structure

To build my timer board was cardboard, stickers, markers, and a hot-glue gun: all materials I had at home. To build the actual timer I used the Arduino software for the code. I created a 20 second timer using a servo, some wires, and an ultrasonic sensor to create a timer that recognizes hand movement. The timer turns on when the sensor senses movement. My goal is for everyone in my home to wash their hands for 20+ seconds. 

Here are some pics as I was crafting!

## ONSHAPE PROTOTYPE

This prototype was created using OnShape 3D sofware. 
[This prototype was created using OnShape 3D sofware.](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c1236d044a9114e1e5bf3d73/w/919ba9e70ec92b83b01069eb/e/c19d85469ad34c92f6a5c510 "OnShape Design")

The dotted lines indicate cuts- there are three cuts in the cube- the bottom, back, and (<1 in) square in the middle of the cube's front side.  

STAY SAFE. STAY HOME. WASH YOUR HANDS-  And take care :)
