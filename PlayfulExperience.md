## PPROJECT 2- Playful Experience 
It's been a stressful and confusing couple of weeks. It seems like all we talk about is COVID-19. No doubt, the virus is scary and it's in our minds all the time- therefore, for my project I wanted to put my anxiety to good use by creating a project that would allow myself and my family safe(ish). 

The CDC recommends everyone wash their hands for at least 20 seconds to ensure most germs are washed off and your hands are nice and clean! Soooooo, I created a 20 second timer!

## Structure

Due to my complete self-quarantine, I have not been able to leave the house- therefore, the only materials I could use to build my timer board was cardboard, stickers, markers, and a hot-glue gun: all materials I had at home. To build the actual timer I used the Arduino software for the code. I created a 20 second timer using a servo, some wires, and an ultrasonic sensor to create a timer that recognizes hand movement. The timer turns on when the sensor senses movement. My goal is for everyone in my home to wash their hands for 20+ seconds. 

Here are some pics as I was crafting!

## ONSHAPE PROTOTYPE

This prototype was created using OnShape 3D sofware.

The dotted lines indicate cuts- there are three cuts in the cube- the bottom, back, and (<1 in) square in the middle of the cube's front side.  

STAY SAFE. STAY HOME. WASH YOUR HANDS-  And take care :)
