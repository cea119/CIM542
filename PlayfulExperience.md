## PPROJECT 2- Playful Experience 

It's been a stressful and confusing couple of weeks. It seems like all we talk about is COVID-19. No doubt, the virus is scary and it's on our minds non-stop- therefore, for my project I wanted to put my anxiety to good use by creating a project that would allow myself and my family to feel a little safer(ish). 

The CDC recommends everyone wash their hands for at least 20 seconds to ensure most germs are washed off and your hands are nice and clean! Soooooo, I created a timer to make sure I get to those 20 seconds when washing my hands!

## Structure

To build my timer board was cardboard, stickers, markers, and a hot-glue gun: all materials I had at home. To build the actual timer I used the Arduino software for the code. I created a 20 second timer using a servo, some wires, and an ultrasonic sensor to create a timer that recognizes hand movement. The timer turns on when the sensor senses movement. My goal is for everyone in my home to wash their hands for 20+ seconds. 

Here are some pics as I was crafting!

## ONSHAPE PROTOTYPE

This prototype was created using OnShape 3D sofware.

The dotted lines indicate cuts- there are three cuts in the cube- the bottom, back, and (<1 in) square in the middle of the cube's front side.  

STAY SAFE. STAY HOME. WASH YOUR HANDS-  And take care :)
