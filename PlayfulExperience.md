## PPROJECT 2- Playful Experience 
It's been a stressful and confusing couple of weeks where it seems like most only talk about COVID-19. No doubt, the virus is scary and it's in our minds all the time- therefore, for my project I wanted to put my anxiety to good use by creating a project that would allow myself and my family safe(ish). 

The CDC recommends everyone wash their hands for at least 20 seconds to ensure most germs are washed off and your hands are nice and clean! Sooooooo, I created a 20 second timer using a servo, some wires, and an ultrasonic sensor to create a timer that recognizes hand movement. My goal is for everyone in my home to wash their hands for 20+ seconds.

## Sculpture

My paper sculpture was built using this [Template Maker](https://www.templatemaker.nl/en/boxlid/) site and illustrator. I used the Cricuit Maker to cut and draw the shapes out. I originally designed the heart for my graphic design class. It was inteded to be a part of a pattern- which would be used to create a cool merch brand; however, I saw the opportunity to use it for this project and took advantage of it.

I created my own blinking pattern and used the Mode Changer code to link my button to my LEDs. I purposely made the LEDs blink quickly and in different directions in order to convey the feeling of an anxious and racing heart. Many people identify with the feeling of an anxious heart- and I attempted to bring that feeling to life through this prototype. 

## Circuit

* 3 - 220ohm resistors
* 1- 10k resistor
* 2 - Red LEDs
* 1- White LEDs
* 1 - Arduino Micro

## Issues

* I had some trouble with drawing the heart on the box- the heart's .ai file has a lot of detail and the printerr found it hard to print
*I should have made a platform for the box to stand on- to hide the wires & make a more steady structure
